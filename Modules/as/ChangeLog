2000-08-10  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.25
	*  decode.cl: request-query will now convert items in query
	    strings without values into ("keyname" . "") in the resulting
	    alist.
	*  doc/aserve.html - update doc of request-query and 
	   request-query-value to reflect what happens with null valued
	   query elements

2000-08-09  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  publish.cl: write the transfer encoding as all lowercase 'chunked'
	   since a bug in Mozilla M17 means it will only understand this form.
	*  htmlgen/htmlgen.cl - add the <caption> tag

2000-08-04  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>
1.1.24
	*  examples/chat.cl - add user logins and private messages 
	        between users.

2000-07-31  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  main.cl: if a multipart-mixed body was being sent then
	    note that the request-body has been grabbed.

2000-07-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	*  example/chat.cl - enhanced to support logging into the chat

2000-07-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.22
	
	*  main.cl: incf version 

2000-07-15  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	*  examples/chat.cl - sample program that does web based chat

2000-07-14  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* client.cl - now do-http-request will always return a uri object
	    (previously it would return its uri arg unless a redirect
             was done in which case it would return a uri object)

2000-07-01  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* client.cl - handle the "100 continue" response we seem to 
	 get from IIS whenever we do a post.

2000-06-25  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* keep track all of all ip addresses by which the server
	  is contacted (this is simpler than trying to figure them
	  out in advance).
	* add function to find a response object given the code.
	* keep track of the raw uri by which a request was made
	  (as distinguished from the uri in which we've added the
	  host and port values).  This is necessary to distriguish
	  when we must proxy.
	* in html-print assume that attribute values are already html escaped

2000-06-12  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* main.cl: add utility function request-query-value to
		combine getting the query info via request query
		and locating the particular value with assoc

2000-06-08  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.21
	* client.cl - do-http-request: 
	        1. give the redirect arg a numeric
		   value to prevent infinite redirect loops.
	        2. handle two other redirect codes
		3. autoredirect only for get and head
		4. return the uri accessed as the fourth value
	* main.cl - add more response codes
		- handle calls to request-query specifying different
		 uri and post values.
	* examples.cl - add redirect test
	* t-aserve.cl - test redirection
	* doc/aserve.html  - update for changes above
	* doc/tutorial.html - don't be so cookie centric

2000-05-30  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.20
	* macs.cl - add note about where to find the if* macro
	* main.cl - cache result of get-request-body so that it can
		    safely be called more than once inside a response
	            function.   Also be sure to call get-request-body 
	            if the connection is keep-alive and there might 
	            be a body following the headers.
	* t-aserve.cl - test enhancment to get-request-body
	* doc/aserve.html - fix do-http-request documentation to
	            reflect change made in 1.1.18
	            

	
Fri May 26 22:42:12 PST 2000  Duane Rettig  <duane@beta>

	* main.cl: incf version
	
2000-05-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.18	
	* ! Non upward-compatiable change ! - the function
	   do-http-request returns arguments in a different
	   order, it now returns the body value first, then the
	   response code and then the headers.
	* fixed bug in publish-directory (sourceforge bug 105426)
	* added query and content-type arguments to do-http-request
	  and make-http-client-request.  These make it even easier
	  to send form data to web servers
	
	
2000-05-16  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.17


	* in order to make portions of the LGPL license meaningful
	  for a Lisp program we've added a prequel to the license
	  agreement in the file license-allegroserve.txt.

2000-05-16  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* client.cl
	  - increase header reading buffer size - but we should
	    make this growable.
	  - handle cookies with = signs embedded
	* decode.cl 
	  - in query-to-form-urlencoded all the values to
	    be non-strings and in that case use ~a format to stringify them
        * parse.cl 
	  - add arg to utility function
	
2000-05-04  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.16
	* request-query can now read from uri and/or post'ed body
	  see doc/aserve.html for details

2000-04-26  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.15
	* ! Non upward-compatible change ! -- the function
	    decode-form-urlencoded has been renamed
	    form-urlencoded-to-query so as to match its new inverse
	    function: query-to-form-urlencoded

	* added query-to-form-urlencoded to allow one to encode
	  query to strings for use by client code.

2000-04-24  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.14
	* verify that it works in acl501 trial (Linux)

2000-04-24    <jkf@CROW>

	* load.cl: make aServe load in acl5.0.1 Lite (Windows) but
	   be advised that it doesn't work very well due to socket
	   problems that can be patched in the Lite version.

	* main.cl: the default timeout for a with-http-response
		now comes from *http-response-timeout* and it
		now defaults to 120 seconds rather than 60.
	
	* some documention updates

2000-04-23  jkf  <jkf@main.verada.com>

	* client.cl - added proxy argument so that client requests
	    can go through a proxy
	* various doc fixes

2000-04-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.13
	* rename Allegro iServe to AllegroServe.
	  As a result where iserve was used before we now use aserve.
	  For example the package is now called net.aserve.


2000-04-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.12

	* add test/t-iserve.cl to the list of files in the ftp distribution

2000-04-16    <jkf@DEEDEE>

	* debug-on and debug-off are no longer exported symbols.
	  They continue to exist but you have to use
          net.iserve::debug-on and net.iserve::debug-off to reach them.

	* added two new response type symbols to aid in doing redirections:
	    *response-moved-permanently*
	    *response-temporary-redirect*
	  note that netscape 4 doesn't understand *response-temporary-redirect*
          as that's a http/1.1 thing.
	
	* request-query takes a :handle-post keyword arguments.  When true
	  (and that's the default) it will automatically read,
	  extract, parse and cache the query string from the entity body
	  when the request is a post request.
	  
2000-03-28  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* move htmlgen.html from htmlgen/ to doc/ so that it's in
	  a consistent place regardless of distribution type.

2000-04-08    <jkf@DEEDEE>
1.1.11
	* make the debugging output feature based rather than
	  numeric. see  net.iserve:debug-on
	* properly do client queries
	* use setfable reply-header-slot-value to read and set 
	  headers for the reply that will be sent
	* always send back HTTP/1.1 as our protocol

	
2000-03-27  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.10

	  to allow you to add headers
	* fix client requests for :head so it doesn't wait for a body
	  to be returned
	* fix debugging output when running inside emacs
	* add client info to documentation.

	  and if the emacs-lisp interface is running, cause a new
	  emacs window to appear in which you can debug the problem
	
	* add net.iserve::*trap-errors* (default t).  If set to
	  nil then errors in http processing by iserve will result
	  in error break loops.

	* fixed errors in publish-directory.  Also prevent user from
	passing ../ in urls to access above the published directory
	
2000-03-22  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>

	* minor fixups in tutorial
	
2000-03-20  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.5
	* include iservelogo.gif in the ftp distribution
	* fix problem where the response to a file entity request
	  for a file that doesn't exist would cause browser to hang
	  until the socket was closed

2000-03-17  John Foderaro  <jkf@tiger.franz.com>
1.1.4
	* change source-readme.txt and load.cl so that
	  it will build on Windows without the unix tools
